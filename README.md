Project: Website for an agricultural farm
Description:
This project is a modern and interactive agri-farm website designed using advanced technologies and methodologies to ensure user experience and ease of support. The site provides users with information about the farm, services and products, as well as the ability to contact the farm and place orders online.

jQuery: Used to create interactive elements and improve user experience by dynamically changing content without reloading the page.
BEM: The BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) ‚Äã‚Äãmethodology is applied to organize the code, which ensures modularity and reuse of components.
